This is a bucket repo for holding experiments and tests related to "non-equilibrium" Cloudy models. 

By "non-equilibrium" I mean either:

+ Explicitly time-dependent, \(d A/d t\) terms non-zero; or
+ Steady-state dynamics, \( \vec{\nabla} .( \vec{u} A ) \) terms non-zero

Cloudy cannot do non-steady dynamics yet.
