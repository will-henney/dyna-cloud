* Time dependence and dynamics with Cloudy

** Tests

*** Radiative energy conservation
    CLOCK: [2012-11-06 Tue 19:20]--[2012-11-06 Tue 19:32] =>  0:12

+ For an infinite plane parallel slab, the total reprocessed flux radiated from the illuminated face should be equal to the incident flux.
+ There is already a file in the Cloudy test suite that does something very similar
  + [[file:~/Work/CLOUDY/SVN/trunk/tsuite/experimental/orion_hii_pdr.in]]



** Applications

*** Globule ionization front

+ 
*** Evaporating molecular disk


** Emacs

*** Major mode to edit Cloudy input files

+ The C-style comments and the fortan-style comments work
+ But the comments after a blank line do not
+ And neither do the keywords
