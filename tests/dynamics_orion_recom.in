c ========================================
c 

This is a model similar in spirit to the blister geometry H+ region
model computed by Baldwin et al. (1991), but with a D-critical flow.
Many physical processes have been disabled to make this simulationn faster.
Grain physics is not done so the gas temperature is incorrect.  The
main purpose is to do a quick test of the dynamical flow with grain
opacities included.  The slow directory contains a full simulation
of a flow like Orion.
