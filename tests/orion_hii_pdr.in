title test grain energy conservation
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c the incident continuum is two parts
c star and flux of photons striking it
// >>chng 03 sep 12, now go deep into omc1 and cannot assume plane par geometry
c this is the photosphere of the OVI star, its temperature and Q(H)
c this is the result of this command
c table star kurucz 39600 K
c and makes it possible to run these orion sims without
c installing the stellar atmosphere files 
table read "star_kurucz_39600.dat" 
phi(H) 13
c this adds the observed hot brems, its temperature and the flux of 
c photons striking the cloud
brems 6
phi(h) 10
// >>chng 03 apr 30, add cosmic rays to model
c add cosmic rays, which are important in the pdr
cosmic rays, background
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
c this sets the separation from the star and the face of the cloud
// >>chng 00 oct 13, from 50 to 10
// >>chng 04 nov 09, introduce off option
c this turns off the stop temperature opption
c the sim will not stop due to temperature
stop temperature off
c this is typical of a gmc, larson 1981
c stop total hydrogen column density 22
stop av 1000 
// >>chng 02 dec 21, change to set thickness, with new hmole
// co hits asymptote at 0.9 and so does not stop due to co
// >>chng 03 sep 12, co network cleaned up, reset thickness to
// 1 parsec, roughly the width of the cloud
c this sets the thickness of the HII region & PDR
//>>chng 05 nov 22, from 1 to 0.5 pc, so stop before ices fully form
c stop thickness 0.5 linear parsec 
// >>chng 01 dec 30, make constant gas pressure to avoid Lya rad pressure
c assume constant pressure
c constant gas pressure 
// >>chng 06 aug 21, make total pressure so like orion_hii_open
constant pressure 
c this will result in a milli gauss B-field in molecular region
magnetic field -5 gauss
c the orion environment full covers the star, so turn on sphere
sphere 
c we have a spherical geometry but want to simulate observing
c through a spectrometer's slit.  use the aperture
c command for this
aperture beam 
c
c other commands for details     =========
// >>chng 03 sep 12, add this command
c mimic existence of unmodeled molecular gas
double 
c iterate since lines optically thick
c iterate
c the observed microturbulence, partially a flow, so not included in pressure
turbulence 8 km/sec no pressure
c set the line width so lines appear on the save continuum
set save line width 10 km/s
c there should be no failures at all
failures 3
c
c this model goes quite deep, needs lots of zones
// >>chng 06 aug 12, do not let zoness become thick to IR grain emission
set nend 2200
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
c this is the log of the initial H density, cm-3
hden 4
c this will speed up the calculation a bit
init file="ism.ini"
c this uses HII region abundances, but no grains
abundances hii region no grains
c this turns on orion grains, but leaves quantum heating off to save time
grains orion no qheat
c turn on PAHs, with an abundance that depends on H0 fraction,
c as suggested by long-slit observations of Orion bar,
c with an abundance 3x larger than default built into the code
grains pah function 3 no qheat 
c 
c commands controlling output    =========
normalize to "O  1" 63.17m
c print lots of faint CO lines
print line faint -4
