c commands for density & abundances =========
hden 3.5

c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
wind velo -5 km/s advection
set dynamics shock depth 15
set drmax 13
set dynamics advection length fraction 0.1
c this accounts for matter beyond end of the model
double optical depths
sphere 
// >>chng 06 jul 05, stop on AV rather than temperature */
// >>chng 08 jul 01, from 15 to 5 
stop depth linear 1.2e15
c
c other commands for details     =========
iterate 30
magnetic field -4 
cosmic rays background 
c this has no effect on dynamics, but is to desaturate the lines as per flow
turbulence 8 km/sec no pressure
c try to speed up simulation without hurting dynamics
init "fast.ini"
c use Bakes & Tielens heating
set PAH Bakes 
set save hash "return"
* init "c84.ini"
* failures 5

This is one of a series of models, designed to test 
stationary low Mach number shocks in photoionized gas
